# CÆSER MVP Development Plan: DAY 3 and DAY 3.5

This document provides a detailed, actionable plan for **DAY 3** and **DAY 3.5** of the CÆSER MVP development for the Qloo Hackathon. The goal is to create a functional MVP within 10 days, integrating Qloo's API for cultural insights and DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES via OpenRouter.ai for predictive analytics. The MVP focuses on predicting demand for a product (e.g., sneakers) based on cultural preferences and delivering actionable insights to merchants.

## DAY 3: Implement Synthetic Buyer Modeling and Compute Hype Scores

**Objective**: Develop a synthetic buyer model to simulate consumer behavior based on cultural insights and compute a hype score reflecting product popularity potential.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Design Synthetic Buyer Model (2 hours)**  
   - Define buyer personas based on cultural insights (e.g., "Streetwear Enthusiast in NYC").  
   - Use Qloo's API to fetch affinity data for different regions and categories.  
   - Create a simple rule-based system to simulate buyer reactions (e.g., likelihood to purchase based on affinity scores).  
   - **Deliverable**: Documented buyer personas and behavior rules.

2. **Implement Synthetic Buyer Model (3 hours)**  
   - Use Python's `random` and `numpy` libraries to simulate buyer interactions.  
   - Create a function in `/api/buyer_model.py`:  
     ```python
     import random
     import numpy as np

     def simulate_buyers(insights, num_buyers=100):
         affinities = insights.get("affinities", [])
         reactions = []
         for _ in range(num_buyers):
             reaction = np.random.normal(loc=affinities[0], scale=0.1)
             reactions.append(reaction)
         return reactions
     ```  
   - **Deliverable**: Functional buyer simulation code.

3. **Integrate with Qloo API (1 hour)**  
   - Fetch cultural insights for the product category and region.  
   - Pass insights to the buyer model:  
     ```python
     insights = get_cultural_insights("sneakers", "NYC")
     reactions = simulate_buyers(insights)
     ```  
   - **Deliverable**: Integrated buyer model using Qloo data.

4. **Compute Hype Scores (2 hours)**  
   - Define hype score as the average reaction score from synthetic buyers.  
   - Implement in `/api/hype_score.py`:  
     ```python
     def compute_hype_score(reactions):
         return sum(reactions) / len(reactions)
     ```  
   - **Deliverable**: Hype score calculation.

5. **Test with Sample Data (1 hour)**  
   - Use sample product and region to generate hype scores.  
   - Validate scores against expected outcomes (e.g., high affinity regions should have higher scores).  
   - **Deliverable**: Tested hype scores for sample inputs.

6. **Document Progress (30 minutes)**  
   - Update `README.md` with buyer model and hype score details.  
   - Commit to GitHub:  
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "feat: Synthetic buyer modeling and hype score computation"
     git push
     ```

**Total Time**: 9.5 hours  
**Deliverables**:  
- Synthetic buyer model integrated with Qloo API.  
- Hype score computation.  
- Tested sample outputs.

## DAY 3.5: Develop Demand Forecasting Logic and Refine Outputs

**Objective**: Implement demand forecasting based on hype scores and cultural insights, and refine outputs for merchant usability.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Design Demand Forecasting Algorithm (2 hours)**  
   - Use hype scores and cultural insights to predict demand uplift.  
   - Consider factors like regional affinity, product category, and historical trends (if available).  
   - **Deliverable**: Documented forecasting logic.

2. **Implement Forecasting Logic (3 hours)**  
   - Use a simple linear regression model or rule-based approach.  
   - Create a function in `/api/forecasting.py`:  
     ```python
     def predict_demand(hype_score, base_demand=100):
         uplift = (hype_score - 0.5) * 2  # Example scaling
         return base_demand * (1 + uplift)
     ```  
   - **Deliverable**: Functional forecasting code.

3. **Integrate with Existing System (1 hour)**  
   - Connect forecasting to the buyer model and hype score outputs.  
   - Ensure seamless data flow from input to prediction.  
   - **Deliverable**: Integrated forecasting module.

4. **Refine Outputs for Merchants (2 hours)**  
   - Enhance dashboard to display demand predictions clearly.  
   - Add visualizations (e.g., bar charts for demand by region).  
   - **Deliverable**: User-friendly output display.

5. **Conduct Thorough Testing (1 hour)**  
   - Test with multiple product categories and regions.  
   - Validate predictions against hypothetical scenarios.  
   - **Deliverable**: Reliable demand forecasts.

6. **Document Progress (30 minutes)**  
   - Update `README.md` with forecasting logic and output details.  
   - Commit to GitHub:  
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "feat: Demand forecasting and output refinement"
     git push
     ```

**Total Time**: 9.5 hours  
**Deliverables**:  
- Demand forecasting logic integrated.  
- Refined, actionable outputs.  
- Comprehensive testing completed.
