# CÆSER MVP Development Checklist
## Version: 1.2
## Last Updated: 2025-07-19

### Introduction
Esteemed user, this checklist delineates the 5-day development plan for CÆSER (Cultural Affinity Simulation Engine for Retail), an AI system crafted to predict, simulate, and strategize market behavior for e-commerce merchants through cultural intelligence and predictive analytics. The primary aim is to secure the Qloo Hackathon Grand Prize by July 29, 2025, whilst ensuring adaptability for the RevenueCat Shipaton 2025 (August 1–September 30, 2025). The system integrates Qloo’s Taste AI™ API for cultural insights and DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek V3, or Kimi K2 via OpenRouter.ai for predictive analytics, delivering actionable insights to merchants.

  - [X] `/data` - Data processing and storage
  - [X] `/tests` - Unit and integration tests
  - [X] `/docs` - Project documentation
- [X] Ensure proper separation of concerns between modules
- [X] Document module organization and dependencies
- [X] Standardize naming conventions across the project
- [X] Create `README.md` in each directory explaining its purpose

## Daily Milestones

### Day 1: Setup and API Integration
- [ ] Obtain Qloo API key (initiate request immediately to avoid delays) - WILL BE PROVIDED LATER
- [ ] Obtain OpenRouter.ai API key for DeepSeek R1, V3, or Kimi K2 access and put them in environment file in root. - WILL BE PROVIDED LATER
- [X] Set up project structure with `/api`, `/frontend`, `/data`, `/tests`, `/docs`
- [X] Integrate Qloo API to fetch cultural insights (e.g., sneaker affinities in NYC); use mock data if key acquisition is delayed
- [X] Initialize SQLite database for storing insights
- [ ] Commit initial setup to public GitHub repository

### Day 2: LLM Integration and Prompt Design
- [ ] Integrate DeepSeek R1, V3, or Kimi K2 via OpenRouter.ai, ensuring connectivity
- [ ] Design prediction prompts for demand uplift and marketing strategies; allocate extra time for optimization to ensure accuracy
- [ ] Implement output processing with robust error handling (e.g., parse incomplete LLM responses)
- [ ] Test LLM integration with sample Qloo data (e.g., sneaker preferences)
- [ ] Log API call performance and errors for debugging
- [ ] Commit LLM integration and prompt design to GitHub

### Day 3: Synthetic Buyer Modeling and Demand Forecasting
- [ ] Implement lightweight synthetic buyer modeling using Qloo’s affinity data (focus on single use case, e.g., sneakers in NYC)
- [ ] Compute hype scores based on synthetic buyer reactions (e.g., average reaction score)
- [ ] Develop simple demand forecasting logic (e.g., rule-based or linear regression)
- [ ] Integrate modeling with Streamlit dashboard for visualization
- [ ] Test modeling and forecasting with sample inputs
- [ ] Commit modeling and forecasting code to GitHub

### Day 4: Testing and Demo Preparation
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow, prioritizing critical paths (Qloo API, LLM predictions, UI rendering, Discord alerts)
- [ ] Fix bugs and optimize performance (e.g., cache Qloo API responses, reduce UI load times)
- [ ] Prepare demo script outlining key features and use case (e.g., 25% uplift prediction for NYC streetwear)
- [ ] Record and edit a 3-minute demo video showcasing Qloo and DeepSeek integration
- [ ] Upload demo video to YouTube or Vimeo and obtain public link
- [ ] Draft project description for hackathon submission, emphasizing merchant value
- [ ] Commit testing results and demo materials to GitHub

### Day 5: Deployment and Submission
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku; prepare Vercel as a backup hosting option for redundancy
- [ ] Conduct final testing on deployed app to identify deployment-specific issues
- [ ] Ensure GitHub repository is public and includes comprehensive documentation (README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING)
- [ ] Submit Qloo Hackathon entry with:
  - [ ] Public demo app URL
  - [ ] Public GitHub repository link
  - [ ] Demo video link (YouTube/Vimeo)
  - [ ] Project description highlighting Qloo and DeepSeek integration
- [ ] Verify submission receipt (e.g., confirmation email)
- [ ] Commit final deployment and submission details to GitHub

---

## Post-Qloo Submission Planning for RevenueCat Shipaton 2025
- [ ] Plan mobile app conversion using React Native or Flutter for cross-platform support
- [ ] Integrate RevenueCat SDK for in-app purchases (e.g., subscription tiers for advanced analytics)
- [ ] Develop monetization strategy:
  - [ ] Free tier: Basic cultural insights and predictions
  - [ ] Paid tier: Advanced analytics, A/B testing simulations ($5–10/month)
- [ ] Create #BuildInPublic strategy for social media engagement (e.g., Twitter/X posts on progress, starting with Qloo submission announcement)

---

## Gitignore Additions
- [ ] Add API key patterns (`*.key`, `*.env.local`)
- [ ] Add IDE-specific files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- [ ] Add build artifacts (`/dist/`, `/build/`)
- [ ] Add temporary files (`*.tmp`, `*.temp`)
- [ ] Add local development files (`local.settings.json`)
- [ ] Add test output files (`/test-results/`)
- [ ] Add dependency directories (`/node_modules/`, `/venv/`)

---

## Best Practices

### API Key Management
- [ ] Store keys in environment variables only
- [ ] Never commit actual keys to version control
- [ ] Maintain `.env.example` with placeholder values
- [ ] Implement key rotation every 90 days
- [ ] Restrict API key permissions to minimum required
- [ ] Use separate keys for development and production
- [ ] Monitor and audit key usage regularly
- [ ] Revoke compromised keys immediately

### Error Handling
- [ ] Implement retry logic for API calls (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- [ ] Validate all inputs before processing
- [ ] Implement fallback behaviors for failed dependencies (e.g., mock data for API failures)
- [ ] Log errors with sufficient context (timestamp, request ID, etc.)
- [ ] Provide user-friendly error messages in UI
- [ ] Create error codes for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Monitor error rates and alert on spikes
- [ ] Document error handling patterns for developers

### Documentation Standards
- [ ] Create comprehensive `README.md` with:
  - [ ] Project overview
  - [ ] Setup instructions
  - [ ] Usage examples
  - [ ] API reference
  - [ ] Contribution guidelines
- [ ] Enforce code commenting standards:
  - [ ] Module-level docstrings
  - [ ] Function docstrings (parameters, returns)
  - [ ] Complex logic explanations
- [ ] Generate API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` following Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
  - [ ] Code style guidelines
  - [ ] Pull request process
  - [ ] Testing requirements
- [ ] Document architecture decisions (ADR)

### Testing Approach
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ unit test coverage
- [ ] Test all API integrations with mocked responses
- [ ] Create end-to-end test scenarios for core workflows
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] Use `pytest` for Python unit tests
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Performance test high-traffic endpoints
- [ ] Document test cases and expected behaviors

---

## Time Management and Buffers
- [ ] Allocate small time buffers for unforeseen issues, especially on Days 4 and 5
- [ ] Conduct daily stand-up meetings (if team-based) to track progress and address blockers
- [ ] Regularly review progress and adjust tasks to stay on schedule

---

## Additional Considerations
- [ ] Ensure compliance with Qloo Hackathon rules (e.g., video length under 3 minutes, public accessibility)
- [ ] Verify all submission materials (demo URL, GitHub link, video link, description) are complete and accessible
- [ ] Prepare mock data for API key delays to maintain development momentum
- [ ] Focus on a single, clear use case (e.g., sneakers in NYC) to manage time constraints
- [ ] Design MVP with modularity for easy adaptation to a mobile app for RevenueCat Shipaton
- [ ] Monitor API usage to avoid rate limits (Qloo, OpenRouter.ai)
- [ ] Use collaboration tools (e.g., Trello, Slack) for team coordination if applicable
