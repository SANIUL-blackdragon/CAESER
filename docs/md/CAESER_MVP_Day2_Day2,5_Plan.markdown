# CÆSER MVP Development Plan: Day 2 and DAY 2.5

This document provides a detailed, actionable plan for **Day 2** and **DAY 2.5** of the CÆSER MVP development for the Qloo Hackathon. The goal is to create a functional MVP within 10 days, integrating Qloo's API for cultural insights and DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES via OpenRouter.ai for predictive analytics. The MVP focuses on predicting demand for a product (e.g., sneakers) based on cultural preferences and delivering actionable insights to merchants.

## Day 2: Integrate DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES via OpenRouter.ai and Design Prompts

**Objective**: Set up DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES integration, design prompts for demand predictions and marketing strategies, and test with sample data.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Set Up OpenRouter.ai Integration (2 hours)**  
   - Sign up for [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) and obtain a free API key.  
   - Install required libraries:  
     ```bash
     pip install langchain
     ```  
   - Configure LangChain to use DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES in `/api/llm_client.py`:  
     ```python
     from langchain.llms import OpenRouter
     import os

     llm = OpenRouter(
         api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY"),
         model_name="deepseek-r1"
     )

     def test_llm():
         response = llm("Hello, world!")
         return response
     ```  
   - Run `test_llm()` to confirm the LLM responds correctly.  
   - **Deliverable**: Working DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES connection.

2. **Design Prompts for Predictions (3 hours)**  
   - Define input: product details (e.g., name, category) and Qloo cultural insights.  
   - Create a prompt template in `/api/prompts.py`:  
     ```python
     def generate_prediction_prompt(product, insights):
         return f"""
         Given the product '{product}' and cultural insights {insights},
         predict the demand uplift as a percentage and suggest a marketing strategy.
         """  
     ```  
   - Test variations in a Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/prompts.ipynb`) to optimize output quality.  
   - **Deliverable**: Refined prompt template.

3. **Implement LLM Output Processing (2 hours)**  
   - Parse LLM responses to extract uplift percentage and strategy:  
     ```python
     def process_llm_output(response):
         lines = response.split("\n")
         uplift = next((line for line in lines if "uplift" in line.lower()), "Unknown")
         strategy = next((line for line in lines if "strategy" in line.lower()), "Unknown")
         return {"uplift": uplift, "strategy": strategy}
     ```  
   - Store results in SQLite via `/api/db.py`.  
   - **Deliverable**: Structured, stored LLM outputs.

4. **Test Integration with Sample Data (2 hours)**  
   - Use sample input: `product = "New Sneaker Launch"`, `insights = get_cultural_insights("sneakers", "NYC")`.  
   - Generate predictions: `response = llm(generate_prediction_prompt(product, insights))`.  
   - Validate coherence and relevance of outputs, tweaking prompts if needed.  
   - **Deliverable**: Successful sample predictions.

5. **Refine and Optimize (1 hour)**  
   - Monitor API call performance and optimize (e.g., reduce latency).  
   - Add error handling for timeouts or invalid responses.  
   - Implement logging for debugging LLM interactions.  
   - **Deliverable**: Stable LLM integration.

6. **Document Progress (30 minutes)**  
   - Update `README.md` with LLM setup, prompt design, and testing instructions.  
   - Commit to GitHub:  
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "feat: DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES integration and prompt design"
     git push
     ```

**Total Time**: 10.5 hours  
**Deliverables**:  
- DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES integrated via OpenRouter.ai.  
- Optimized prompts and processed outputs.  
- Tested sample predictions.

## DAY 2.5: Test End-to-End Flow, Refine, and Prepare Demo

**Objective**: Validate the full MVP workflow, fix issues, and prepare hackathon submission materials.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Test End-to-End Flow (2 hours)**  
   - Simulate a user journey:  
     - Input product details in Streamlit dashboard.  
     - Submit to trigger Qloo API and LLM predictions.  
     - View insights on dashboard and receive Discord alert.  
   - Check data fetching, processing, storage, and display for errors.  
   - **Deliverable**: Working end-to-end workflow.

2. **Refine MVP (2 hours)**  
   - Address bugs (e.g., API failures, UI issues).  
   - Optimize performance for API calls and data rendering.  
   - Add user feedback (e.g., loading spinners, error messages).  
   - **Deliverable**: Polished MVP.

3. **Prepare Demo Video (2 hours)**  
   - Script a 3-minute demo:  
     - Introduce CÆSER’s purpose.  
     - Show inputting a product, viewing insights, and receiving alerts.  
     - Emphasize Qloo and DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES integration.  
   - Record using OBS Studio or Zoom, then edit for clarity.  
   - **Deliverable**: Edited demo video.

4. **Prepare Submission Materials (1 hour)**  
   - Write a submission description highlighting:
