     ```  
   - Commit changes to Git and deploy to Heroku:  
     ```
     heroku create aether-mvp
     git push heroku main
     ```  
   - Configure environment variables (e.g., Qloo API key, DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES credentials) in Heroku’s dashboard.  
   - Verify the app is live by accessing the provided URL (e.g., `https://aether-mvp.herokuapp.com`).

   - **Deliverable**: A fully functional and accessible submission.

6. **Document Progress (30 minutes)**
