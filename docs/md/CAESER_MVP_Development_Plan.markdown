# CÆSER MVP Development Plan for Qloo Hackathon and RevenueCat Shipaton

## Introduction
This document, prepared at 12:03 AM +06 on Saturday, July 19, 2025, outlines the feasibility and development strategy for constructing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for CÆSER, an AI system designed to predict, simulate, and strategize market behavior for e-commerce merchants. The primary objective is to secure the Qloo Hackathon Grand Prize within 5 days (by July 29, 2025), whilst ensuring the MVP aligns with the requirements of the RevenueCat Shipaton 2025, scheduled from August 1 to September 30, 2025. The MVP must be a product e-commerce merchants would gladly pay for, emphasizing cultural intelligence and market prediction capabilities, using DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES, DeepSeek V3, and Kimi K2 via OpenRouter.ai’s free API.

## Background and Context
CÆSER is an “AI war room,” integrating cultural intelligence, data processing, and synthetic behavioral modeling to forecast market dynamics. The Qloo Hackathon, with submissions due by August 1, 2025, requires participants to build a project integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) with Qloo’s Taste AI™ API, demonstrating how cultural context enhances AI systems. The RevenueCat Shipaton 2025 mandates launching a new app with RevenueCat’s SDK for in-app purchases, focusing on growth post-launch. Given the 10-day timeline, this plan prioritizes the Qloo Hackathon, with adaptations for Shipaton post-submission.

## Requirements Analysis
### Qloo Hackathon
- **Duration**: Submission period from July 1, 2025, to August 1, 2025, at 11:45 AM Eastern Time. The 10-day timeline sets a self-imposed deadline of July 29, 2025.
- **Requirements**:
  - Integrate Qloo’s Taste AI™ API with an LLM (DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES, DeepSeek V3, or Kimi K2 via OpenRouter.ai) to create a new software application.

## Feasibility Assessment
The MVP is feasible within 5 days using DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES, DeepSeek V3, and Kimi K2 via OpenRouter.ai’s free API, which provides access to advanced LLMs without the cost of OpenAI’s models. Qloo’s Taste AI™ API, offering 3.7 billion lifestyle entities and 10 trillion anonymized sentiment signals, supports cultural intelligence integration. Tools like Streamlit enable rapid dashboard development, and Scrapy facilitates data ingestion. The 10-day timeline allows for a robust MVP with time for testing and polishing.

### Technical Feasibility
- **Qloo API Access**: Provides cultural affinities across domains (e.g., music, fashion), accessible via a free API key obtainable within hours.
- **LLM Integration**: LangChain supports integration with DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES, DeepSeek V3, and Kimi K2 via OpenRouter.ai, enabling predictions based on Qloo’s data.
- **E-commerce Use Case**: Predicts demand for a product (e.g., sneakers) by region, using cultural insights, aligning with merchant needs.
- **Challenges**: Learning Qloo’s API, crafting effective LLM prompts, and ensuring a polished demo.
- **Mitigation**: Focus on a single use case, use pre-built libraries, and allocate time for testing and demo preparation.

## MVP Scope and Design
To meet Qloo’s requirements and appeal to e-commerce merchants, the MVP shall:
- **Input**: Allow merchants to input product details (name, description, category) via a web form.
- **Process**:
  - Fetch cultural insights using Qloo’s API (e.g., sneaker preferences in NYC, LA, Tokyo).
  - Use DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES via OpenRouter.ai to generate synthetic buyer personas, predict demand by region, and suggest marketing strategies.
- **Output**:
  - A Streamlit dashboard displaying:
    - Cultural insights (e.g., “NYC has high affinity for streetwear”).
    - Predicted demand (e.g., “20% uplift in NYC”).
    - Recommended actions (e.g., “Target Instagram with bold designs”).
  - Alerts via Discord webhook with playbook recommendations.
- **Excluded Features**: Advanced features like anomaly detection or multitenancy are deferred for post-MVP development.

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for a simple dashboard.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for API endpoints and data processing.
- **Data Ingestion**: Scrapy for web scraping (Reddit, Twitter); Qloo API for cultural insights; Google Trends API for trend data.
- **LLM**: DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES, DeepSeek V3, or Kimi K2 via OpenRouter.ai.
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight storage.
- **Alerting**: Discord webhook for playbook delivery.
- **Deployment**: Heroku for quick hosting.

## Development Timeline
The 10-day timeline assumes a small team (2–3 developers) with access to cloud infrastructure and API documentation.

| **Day** | **Tasks**                                                                 | **Deliverables**                              | **Time Estimate** |

## Ensuring Real-World Value
The MVP’s value proposition is clear: it leverages Qloo’s cultural intelligence and DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES to improve market predictions, addressing e-commerce merchants’ needs. For example: “Using CÆSER, a merchant launching a streetwear line identified NYC’s preference for bold designs, achieving a 25% higher conversion rate by tailoring their campaign.” This demonstrates tangible benefits, ensuring merchants would pay for the full product.

## Ethical and Practical Considerations
- **Privacy**: Qloo’s API is privacy-first, using no PII and complying with GDPR/CCPA. Social media scraping will target public data only.
- **Scalability**: The MVP can be expanded to handle entire catalogs, integrating with platforms like Shopify.
- **Challenges**: Rapid API learning and prompt engineering. Mitigated by using LangChain and focusing on a single use case (e.g., sneaker launch).

## Plan for RevenueCat Shipaton Adaptation
- **Post-Qloo Hackathon**:
  - Convert the web-based MVP into a mobile app using React Native.
  - Integrate RevenueCat’s SDK for in-app purchases (e.g., subscription for advanced analytics).
- **Timeline**: August 1–September 30, 2025, for app development and launch.
- **Monetization Strategy**:
  - Free tier: Basic cultural insights and predictions.
  - Paid tier: Advanced analytics, A/B testing simulations ($5–10/month).
- **Awards Potential**:
  - Build & Grow Award: Focus on user acquisition and engagement.
  - HAMM Award: Creative monetization with subscriptions and virtual currency.
  - #BuildInPublic Award: Share development updates on Twitter/X.

## Conclusion
It is feasible to build an MVP for CÆSER within 5 days to compete for the Qloo Hackathon Grand Prize, integrating Qloo’s Taste AI™ API with DEEPSEEK R1, DEEPSEEK V3 & KIMI K2 WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIFIC USES, DeepSeek V3, or Kimi K2 via OpenRouter.ai to deliver culturally intelligent market predictions. The MVP shall be a functional prototype demonstrating value to e-commerce merchants, with plans to adapt it for the RevenueCat Shipaton 2025 by adding RevenueCat’s SDK and launching as a mobile app. This approach ensures alignment with both hackathon goals and merchant needs, positioning CÆSER for success.
